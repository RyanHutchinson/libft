# Libft - C - 2019

Libft is a recreation of C's standard Libraries. What better way to learn that to re-create!

## WeThinkCode:

**Part 1:** 28/28  
**Part 2:** 24/24  
**Bonus:**  6/6  

## Installation:

To get started, clone this repo and go into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ryanhutchinson/libft.git
cd ./libft/libft/
```

### Making:

To compile the libft, you need to run the following commands:

```
make
```

## Using the library:

To use the library, you need to "#include "libft.h"" in your code. If you add a function to the library,
you'll need to add the function in the libft.h file and the Makefile.

### Compiling with libft.a

Run the following command, by adding your main file and all other files you want to compile.

```
gcc [Your Main] [Other Files] libft.a
./a.out
```

## Disclaimer:

This libft won't be changed regularly and is mainly for displaying my experience through the course.

You won't learn anything by copy-pasting code.
Thanks!
